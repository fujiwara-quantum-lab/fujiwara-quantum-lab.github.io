What’s an MOU?



An Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is a legally-non-binding agreement between different parties. It can be thought of as a kind version of a verbal agreement or honorable agreement between parties. 



The purpose of the MOU is to clearly articulate the expectations of all personnel in order to further the co-primary objectives of the group to : (1) produce cutting-edge research; (2) train group members to be successful researchers and scientists; and (3) foster a professional and healthy working environment.  As a member of this group, you agree to adhere to these standards to the best of your ability, but it is also assumed that many of these skills may need to be refined and/or learned. 



In brief, the primary expectations are maintaining a professional decorum, observing proper health and safety protocols, and executing a self-driven work ethic. Additional resources and guidelines are provided at the end of this document. 



All members are expected to adhere to all policies and agreements between you and the department, college, and/or university regardless of this MOU.
