## Code of Conduct
All group members and visitors are expected to respect the general **code of conduct** when in the laboratory or acting as amabassador for the group.  This is to ensure a positive, professional, and productive work environment where all people can fully experience the privleged joy of engaging in scientific endeavors.  I fully hope and expect that working with the group will meet and exceed the following general guidelines.

- mutual respect for your colleagues
- listening to eachother earnestly
- use professional (casual can be okay) language
- asking and giving help

These expectations are in addition to any laws or policies external to the group.  All group members are expected to acknowledge and adhere to the laboratory **Memorandum of Understanding** which explicitly outlines the code of conduct, responsibilities, and mutual expectations.
