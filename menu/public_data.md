# Statement on Data Availability
At the Fujiwara Lab, we strongly believe in making scientific data publically available not only for increasing academic transparency but also for improving science communication and education.  Therefore, from time to time, we will real data that we take in the laboratory.  This includes raw data, processed data, and also educational modules.
