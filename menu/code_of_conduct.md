# Code of Conduct

All group members and visitors are expected to respect the general **code of conduct** when in the laboratory or acting as amabassador for the group.  This is to ensure a positive, professional, and productive work environment where all people can fully experience the privleged joy of engaging in scientific endeavors.  I fully hope and expect that working with the group will meet and exceed the following general guidelines : 

- You will exhibit mutual respect for your colleagues.
- You will listen to your colleagues' input earnestly.
- You will utilize friendly but professional language.
- You will ask for help when needed and you will provide assistance when asked.
- You will exhibit a high degree of academic and professional integrity.

These minimal expectations are in addition to any laws or policies that may apply.  Furthermore, all group members are expected to acknowledge and adhere to the laboratory **Memorandum of Understanding** which explicitly outlines the code of conduct, responsibilities, and mutual expectations.
