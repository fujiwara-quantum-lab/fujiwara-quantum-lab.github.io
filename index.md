# Welcome!
We are a new experimental group in the Physics Department at Lehigh University. 
We utilize trapped gases of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms to investigate exciting properties 
of quantum many-body systems.

**We are currently looking for motivated undergraduate, graduate, and postdocs to join us in constructing the laboratory
and participate in cutting edge research.** See [Openings]({/openings}) for more details.

This page is currently underdevelopment.

### key research topics, themes, and ideas 
ultracold atoms, bose condensation, degenerate fermi gases, optical lattices, quantum simulation,
non-equilibirum physics, quantum thermalization, floquet engineering, disordered system, laser cooling
