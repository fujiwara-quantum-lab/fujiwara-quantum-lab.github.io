We are a new experimental atomic physics group in the Physics Department at Lehigh University. 
We utilize the exquisite precision and control of atomic systems to sythesize gases of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms in order to investigate exotic behavior in 
 quantum many-body systems.

<ins>**We have multiple openings for highly motivated undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs to join us in constructing the laboratory
and participate in cutting edge research.**</ins> See [openings]({/openings}) for more details.

### key research topics, themes, and ideas :
ultracold atoms, bose condensation, degenerate fermi gases, optical lattices, quantum simulation,
non-equilibirum physics, quantum thermalization, floquet engineering, disordered system, laser cooling
